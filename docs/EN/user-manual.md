This document is intended to familiarize the user with the functionality of the site http://sqrt.kovila77.gq/ (https://websqrt.netlify.app/).

This site was created for the course "Methods and Tools for Collaborative Development of Software Systems".


The application has the following features for calculating roots:
- [calculating roots from positive numbers](#calculating-roots-from-positive-numbers),
- [roots out of 0 calculation](#Roots-out-of-0-calculation)
- [calculating roots from negative numbers](#calculating-roots-from-negative-numbers),
- [calculating roots from complex numbers](#calculating-roots-from-complex-numbers),
- [calculating roots from long numbers](#calculating-roots-from-long-numbers),
- [calculate roots of expressions](#calculate-roots-of-expressions),
- [change precision of calculations in long arithmetic when calculating roots from positive numbers](#change-precision-of-calculations-in-long-arithmetic-when-calculating-roots-from-positive-numbers),
- [changing the number of digits after the decimal separator](#changing-number-digits-after-decimal-separator).
